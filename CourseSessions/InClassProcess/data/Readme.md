Data Analytics Course Session (Case): 
---------------------------------------------------------

Sessions 2-3 of INSEAD Big Data Analytics for Business Course: Dimensionality Reduction and Derived Attributes
---------------------------------------------------------

Each data file should be a .csv file with one worksheet which has as many rows as observations (e.g. people in a market research survey), and as many columns as attributes (e.g. people's demographics, attitudes to a product, etc). The .csv is  ";" separated (NOT other symbols, e.g. not ",") and decimals are with ","


File "MBAadmin.csv"" has data from 20 MBA applicants, for each of which we have 7 attributes: "GPA"     "GMAT"    "Fellow"  "Comm"    "JobEx"   "Organze" "Extra". The size of the ProjectData matrix is therefore 20 x 7. See the reading of Sessions 2-3 of the course for more information.

File "Boats.csv"" has data from 2813 people each of which answered 79 survey questions. The size of the ProjectData matrix is therefore 2813 x 79.
