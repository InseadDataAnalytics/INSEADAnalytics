Data Analytics Course Session (Case): 
---------------------------------------------------------
"Sessions 6-7 of INSEAD Big Data Analytics for Business Course: "Classification"
---------------------------------------------------------

Each data file should inlclude a matrix called ProjectData. This matrix has as many rows as observations (e.g. people in a market research survey), and as many columns as attributes (e.g. people's demographics, attitudes to a product, etc).


File DefaultData has data from 42  customers of a resort, for each of which we have 7 attributes: "Visit", "Income", "Travel.Attitude", "Vacation.Importance", "HH.Size", "HH.Head.Age", "Vacation.Spending". The size of the ProjectData matrix is therefore 42 x 7. See the reading of Sessions 6-7 of the course for more information.

File BoatCaseData has data from 2813 people each of which answered 79 survey questions. The size of the ProjectData matrix is therefore 2813 x 79.
